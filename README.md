This is a Cv application project using React Js from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application)'s website.

I really enjoyed working on this project. It has helped me to understand React Js states and props and how to pass information from parent to child components.

Components

Form.js: responsible for rendering the form.

DisplayCvApp.js: responsible for rendering resume after the user has submitted the form.

App.js: Responsible for holding the state, and methods and passing it down to Form.js and 
DisplayCvApp.js.
